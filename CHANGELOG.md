# Changelog
## [0.9.7] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Admin-gated admin-token minting (`POST /api/v1/admin/tokens`)** — a dedicated route, reachable only behind the `/api/v1/admin/` gate (`auth::is_admin_path`), that mints an API token of any role including `admin` for a given subject without the `auth.admin_users` self-service check. Anonymous, `anonymous_read`, Basic-auth (no role) and Read/Write callers are denied fail-closed before the handler; `ttl_days = 0` is rejected and every mint is audit-logged (actor, target, role, ttl — never the token). `auth.admin_users` (`NORA_AUTH_ADMIN_USERS`) thus becomes a bootstrap-only fallback on the unchanged public `POST /api/tokens` route, so GHSA-78cx-cfhm-rgmx stays closed; with auth disabled the route returns `503` (#746, #808).
- **`npm audit` proxied to upstream for remote repos** — `npm audit` POSTs to `/-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk` (npm7) or `/-/npm/v1/security/audits/quick` (npm6), which previously hit the `405` fallback and failed. NORA keeps no advisory database, so for a proxy repo it now forwards the request to the configured upstream and returns the response verbatim. Both audit POSTs are read-eligible under `auth.anonymous_read`, so anonymous `npm audit` works wherever anonymous install does; non-audit npm POSTs stay gated. Under an active `internal_namespaces` filter the `bulk` request strips internal-package keys before forwarding and fail-closes (`200 {}`) on any body it cannot verify, the gzipped `quick` lockfile is refused wholesale, the client `Authorization` is never forwarded, and the body is bounded at 8 MB; upstream 5xx/network → `502`, circuit-open → `503`, no proxy configured → `200 {}` (#597, #805).
- **S3 virtual-hosted-style addressing (`storage.s3_virtual_hosted`, `NORA_STORAGE_S3_VIRTUAL_HOSTED`)** — some S3-compatible providers reject signed path-style requests (Alibaba Cloud OSS answers `403 SecondLevelDomainForbidden`), which made the S3 backend unusable there because the addressing style was hardcoded to path-style. A new default-off toggle threads through `Storage::new_s3` / `S3Storage::new` into `AmazonS3Builder::with_virtual_hosted_style_request`; when enabled, `object_store` uses the configured endpoint verbatim, so it must include the bucket host. Default (`false`) preserves current path-style behavior (#795, #798).
- **Chinese (Simplified) UI translation** — a `中文` entry in the language switcher backed by a full `zh` translation table; language detection now normalizes BCP-47 / POSIX tags to their primary subtag, so `zh-CN`, `zh-Hans` and `ru_RU.UTF-8` resolve correctly (#788).

### Fixed
- **Terraform Provider Network Mirror Protocol** — NORA served only the Terraform Registry Protocol, but its own docs told users to configure `network_mirror`, which speaks the separate Provider Network Mirror Protocol, so every `terraform init` returned `404 "provider … not found in any of the search locations"`. Two mirror endpoints (`GET /terraform/{hostname}/{ns}/{type}/index.json` and `…/{version}.json`) are added as thin adapters over the existing registry-protocol handlers; `{version}.json` runs `check_download` (curation/blocklist parity) and namespace isolation, archive URLs route through NORA's cached/quarantined binary download, per-platform metadata is fetched concurrently, and hashes are `zh:<sha256>` from upstream metadata, fail-closed (a platform with no resolvable shasum is omitted, never served unhashed). The single configured upstream and mirror-mode integrity (Terraform skips origin GPG in mirror mode; NORA does not verify `SHA256SUMS.sig`) are documented as accepted limitations in `COMPAT.md` (#801, #802).

### Security
- **bcrypt `0.19.0` → `0.19.2` (RUSTSEC-2026-0199)** — `bcrypt::verify()` could panic on a 60-byte hash string carrying multi-byte UTF-8 at certain positions (DoS). NORA calls it in `auth/htpasswd.rs` with an operator-controlled hash (not wire-reachable), but the bump clears the advisory repo-wide; lockfile-only (#803).
- **quick-xml `<0.41` DoS advisories (RUSTSEC-2026-0194/-0195) accepted** — transitive via `object_store` (S3 XML parsing); no `object_store` release resolves it yet. Exposure is low (XML comes from the operator-configured S3 backend, not attacker input), so both are ignored in `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny` with the upgrade path tracked in #799 (#800).

## [0.9.6] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Anonymous Docker pull (`auth.docker_anon_pull`, `NORA_AUTH_DOCKER_ANON_PULL`)** — a dedicated, default-off switch that serves `docker pull` without `docker login`. With auth enabled, an anonymous `GET /v2/` returns a `401` Basic challenge (so `docker login` works); under `anonymous_read = true` the manifest/blob reads themselves were served anonymously, but the `/v2/` ping still challenged. Whether a logged-out `docker pull` then succeeded depended on the client's image store: Docker's **containerd** image store tolerated the `/v2/` challenge and pulled anonymously, while the **classic** docker/distribution store cached the Basic challenge and aborted with `no basic auth credentials` (#778). When `docker_anon_pull = true`, the `/v2/` ping returns `200` so anonymous pull works **uniformly for both stores**, and manifest/blob/tag reads are served without auth; writes (push/delete) still require a token, `/v2/_catalog` stays authenticated (no anonymous repository enumeration), and a request that carries an `Authorization` header is still validated (so `docker login -u token -p <nra_…>` and audit attribution keep working). The switch is independent of `anonymous_read`, so serving Maven/raw/npm anonymously never exposes container images. **Behavior change:** anonymous access to Docker `/v2` read endpoints is now governed solely by `docker_anon_pull`. Deployments that pulled images anonymously under `anonymous_read = true` (containerd image store) must set `docker_anon_pull = true` to keep that working. Clients built on `containers/image` (skopeo/podman/buildah) read auth parameters only from the `/v2/` ping, so their *authenticated* operations degrade while the switch is on — keep it off if you need both anonymous pull and authenticated operations for those clients (#778).
- **Upstream circuit-breaker state in `/health`** — the `/health` response gains an `upstreams` section, one entry per enabled proxy registry, so operators without Prometheus/Grafana can see which upstreams are reachable (previously this was only on the `nora_circuit_breaker_state` gauge). Each entry reports `status` — `closed` / `open` / `half_open` (mirroring the gauge labels), or `disabled` when the circuit-breaker feature is off (the default) — plus `failure_count` and `last_failure_seconds_ago`. The state is read from the breaker's cached in-memory snapshot, so `/health` never performs a live upstream probe and stays fast and non-blocking; an enabled registry with no recorded breaker yet defaults to a healthy `closed`. The OpenAPI `HealthResponse` schema is updated to match (#773).

### Fixed
- **A present-but-empty `[<registry>]` table now keeps the default upstream** — npm/pypi `proxy` and maven/docker `proxies`/`upstreams` used a bare `#[serde(default)]` that deserialized to `None`/`[]`, diverging from the `Default` impl's real upstream. Writing `[npm]` (or `[pypi]`/`[maven]`/`[docker]`) in `config.toml` to set, say, a timeout — without restating the proxy key — silently disabled proxying for that registry, while omitting the table entirely kept the upstream. The serde field-default is now single-sourced with the `Default` impl, and a guard test asserts this for every registry section so the class cannot recur. **Behavior change:** if you relied on a present-but-proxy-less table to run a registry local-only (air-gapped), set the proxy env var to empty instead — `NORA_NPM_PROXY=""`, `NORA_PYPI_PROXY=""`, `NORA_MAVEN_PROXIES=""`, `NORA_DOCKER_PROXIES=""`.
- **Docker is now counted in the proxy and quarantine config guards** — two hand-rolled per-registry checks in config validation (the `min_release_age`-needs-quarantine guard and the "any quarantine active" check) enumerated registries by hand and omitted Docker. A Docker-only proxy with `min_release_age` and no quarantine was not flagged, and a Docker-only `[curation.docker] quarantine` was validated incorrectly. Both now derive from a single compiler-exhaustive match over the registry set, so no registry can be silently dropped again (#765).
- **`cargo publish` against the Cargo registry no longer 404s** — the sparse-index `config.json` advertised its `api` base as `{base}/cargo/api`. Cargo appends `/api/v1/...` to that base, so publish requests went to `/cargo/api/api/v1/crates/new` and returned `404`. The advertised `api` base is now the registry mount (`{base}/cargo`), so Cargo builds `/cargo/api/v1/crates/new` and resolves to the mounted route; tests cover both the metadata and publish routes derived from the `config.json` api base (#783).

### Security
- **A per-registry-only quarantine now loads its durable store** — the digest-quarantine store was loaded only when the *global* `curation.quarantine` was set. A Docker-only `[curation.docker] quarantine` got an empty (non-durable) store: after a restart the on-disk first-seen records were ignored, so a still-young, already-cached digest was served before its hold expired. The store now loads whenever any quarantine — global or per-registry — is active (#765). **Behavior change:** an explicit global `curation.quarantine = "off"` no longer loads the store (it has no effect to enforce); set a real mode (`observe`/`enforce`) where you want enforcement.

### Performance
- **Index rebuild drops the per-key `stat()`** — rebuild walked `storage.list()` and then issued a separate `storage.stat()` per key for size/mtime; on S3 that `stat()` is a HEAD, so rebuilding N objects cost 1 LIST + N HEADs, all under the per-registry rebuild lock — the first reader after an invalidation blocked for the whole serialized round-trip. A new additive `StorageBackend::list_with_meta()` reuses the size/mtime the directory walk (local) or LIST response (S3) already carries, so the rebuild pays zero extra HEADs. The default trait impl falls back to `list()` + per-key `stat()`, so every other backend stays correct, and gc/retention/backup/mirror keep using `list()` unchanged; a counting-backend test asserts the rebuild makes zero per-key `stat()` calls (#759).

## [0.9.5] - 2026-06-19

### Security
- **First-seen digest-quarantine generalized to every proxy registry** — the unspoofable first-seen cooldown (previously Docker-only) now guards all 11 proxy registries (npm, PyPI, Cargo, Go, Maven, RubyGems, NuGet, Conan, pub.dev, Terraform, Ansible). `min_release_age` on a proxy path now defers to quarantine, because upstream publish dates are unsigned and several registries expose none. **Breaking:** enabling `min_release_age` on an enabled proxy now requires an active quarantine (or `server.trust_upstream_dates` where a real upstream date is available); a min-age-only proxy policy is rejected at startup (#741, #742).
- **Release-age freshness honored with `trust_upstream_dates` (#748)** — under #742, `min_release_age` defers to quarantine, which holds on NORA's own clock, so a provably-old artifact was held as "new to this mirror" regardless of its release date. When `server.trust_upstream_dates` is set and the registry supplies a date, the quarantine now seeds first-seen from the trusted upstream release date — an artifact older than the TTL matures immediately and is served, while a fresh one is still held. Wired for every dated proxy registry: PyPI (PEP 691 / PEP 700 `upload-time`), npm, Cargo, Go, NuGet, Conan, pub.dev, Maven (Central search API), RubyGems (v1 versions API), Ansible (Galaxy `created_at`) and Terraform (registry.terraform.io `/v2` `published-at` — the standard provider protocol carries no date). Each upstream-date path is gated on `trust_upstream_dates` (spoofable, opt-in); hosted artifacts use cached-metadata mtime. The date is obtained on the artifact download path itself — Cargo self-primes `metadata.json` there (a `cargo build` resolves via the sparse index and never hits `/api/v1/crates/{name}`, so the date would otherwise never be cached), mirroring PyPI's date self-prime. Docker stays on NORA's own clock (digest-addressed, no trusted date). Internal-namespace coordinates are never sent to a hardcoded public date source (Maven Central search, registry.terraform.io `/v2`) — the date query is skipped for internal namespaces (#68/#733). Note: Maven, RubyGems and Terraform query their date source per download request (not cached like PyPI/Cargo/Ansible); this fires only under `trust_upstream_dates` and is timeout-bounded and fail-safe — caching is a tracked follow-up.
- **Docker digest-quarantine bypass fixed (GHSA-4j4m-fchf-gr9r)** — layer/config blobs were served on every path (`Range` and full cache-hit, proxy-stored, proxy temp-file) and via `HEAD` without a quarantine check, and a local push could pre-mature a future upstream digest through the shared ledger key. Blob serves are now gated, and `record_trusted` was removed so the ledger records only proxy-fetched content (CWE-693, CWE-345).
- **Token-management broken access control fixed (GHSA-78cx-cfhm-rgmx)** — the token-management endpoints (`/ui/tokens`, `/api/ui/tokens`, and the public `/api/tokens/revoke`) authenticated the caller but never authorized them, so any write-capable bearer/OIDC identity could enumerate and revoke other users' tokens (including admin and service tokens), and a read identity could enumerate them. List and revoke are now owner-scoped — a non-admin acts only on its own tokens, while admins still manage all — and a non-owned id returns `404` (not `403`) so a caller cannot probe which ids exist (CWE-862).
- **Admin-token self-escalation blocked (GHSA-78cx-cfhm-rgmx)** — the public `POST /api/tokens` route minted whatever role was requested, so any htpasswd account could self-mint an `admin` token. **Breaking:** an `admin` token may now be minted via this route only by an account listed in `auth.admin_users` (`NORA_AUTH_ADMIN_USERS`), which is empty by default; read and write tokens are unaffected. If you rely on this route to create admin tokens, set `NORA_AUTH_ADMIN_USERS=<your-admin-user>` before upgrading (CWE-862).

### Added
- **Admin storage reindex** — `POST /api/v1/admin/reindex` (admin-role token only) refreshes the in-memory indexes from storage so the UI reflects artifacts copied in out-of-band (rsync, Unison, BTRFS send/receive, S3 sync) without a container restart or a dummy client pull. Optional `?registry=<name>` scopes the rebuild to one registry (unknown names return `400`); the rebuild runs in the background and the call returns `202 Accepted`. Repeated calls are debounced (`429` + `Retry-After`). The index is process-local, so under a multi-replica deployment the call refreshes only the replica that served it — reindex each replica or roll the deployment (#735).
- **`server.trust_upstream_dates`** — opt-in flag that lets `min_release_age` use a real upstream publish date where one is cached (e.g. npm `time`), as an enhancement to — not a substitute for — quarantine (#729).
- **npm `/-/whoami` endpoint** — token-based identity so `npm whoami` resolves against a NORA token (#720).
- **`auth.admin_users` (`NORA_AUTH_ADMIN_USERS`)** — a comma-separated list of htpasswd usernames permitted to mint `admin`-role tokens via `POST /api/tokens`; the bootstrap for admin designation (GHSA-78cx-cfhm-rgmx).

### Fixed
- **Index rebuild no longer caches a failed storage scan as a fresh empty result** — if the storage listing errored mid-rebuild, the index was cached empty *and* clean, so the UI could report zero artifacts on healthy data until the next write. A failed scan now leaves the index dirty and retries on the next read (#735).
- **Partial `config.toml`** — missing `[server]`, `[storage]`, or fields like `host`/`port` no longer prevent startup; serde defaults are applied for all unset values.
- **Container image no longer overrides `config.toml`** — the image shipped config *values* (`NORA_PUBLIC_URL`, `NORA_PORT`, `NORA_STORAGE_PATH`, `NORA_AUTH_TOKEN_STORAGE`) as baked `ENV`, which silently won over a user-provided `config.toml` (env has the highest precedence in `Config::load`). Defaults now ship as a file (`/etc/nora/config.toml`, loaded via `NORA_CONFIG_PATH`); a bind-mounted `config.toml` takes full effect. Only `NORA_HOST` stays in `ENV` so binding survives a partial mounted config and the container stays reachable (#719).
- **Namespace isolation now covers every proxy registry's metadata path** — `internal_namespaces` (the dependency-confusion defense, always active) previously gated only the download/tarball path, so a metadata / index / version-list / search request for an internal-namespace package leaked its name upstream on every proxy registry except npm. The guard now runs on the metadata path of PyPI, Cargo, Maven, Go, NuGet, Conan, pub.dev, Terraform, Ansible and RubyGems — and on the NuGet/Conan search query — serving any locally-published or cached copy first and blocking only the genuine upstream fetch (no leak, and no false 403 on a locally-published internal package). The npm TTL-stale metadata refetch is also guarded, closing a residual of #725 (contrib-kit#68).
- **Locally-published internal packages are served instead of being blocked** — `internal_namespaces` is documented as "never proxied *upstream*", but `check_download` ran the always-on namespace filter *before* the local serve, so a mixed proxy+host instance returned 403 for its **own** internal packages on every download path (npm, PyPI, Cargo, Maven, Conan, RubyGems, NuGet, pub.dev, Go, Ansible, Docker, raw) and on the NuGet `registration_index`, pub.dev `package_listing` and RubyGems `compact_index` metadata paths. An internal name now serves any local/cached copy first and blocks only the genuine upstream fetch; an internal name with no local copy is still blocked and never proxied. Non-internal behavior is unchanged (#733).
- **Enforce mode requires at least one active control** — `curation.mode = enforce` no longer hard-requires `allowlist_path`; a blocklist-only, min-release-age-only, or quarantine-only policy is valid, and enforce is rejected only when no control of any kind is configured (#740).
- **Basic-auth accepts an API token as the password** — clients sending an API token over HTTP Basic auth (`user:<token>`) are now authenticated, matching the token-in-header behavior (#737).
- **Crash durability** — the parent directory is `fsync`'d after the atomic rename, so a published artifact survives a power loss immediately after write (#723).
- **npm scoped-package publish** — scoped attachment filenames (`@scope/name`) are normalized, so the tarball is stored and served under the correct key (#724).
- **npm `whoami` response** — serialized via `serde_json` instead of `format!`, avoiding malformed output on unusual usernames (#722).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Multiple PyPI upstream proxies** — `NORA_PYPI_PROXIES` (or `[pypi].proxies`) configures an ordered list of upstreams. The order is the precedence — the first upstream that lists or serves a file wins, like pip's `--index-url` ahead of `--extra-index-url`; locally cached/uploaded files win over all upstreams. The mount-points table in the UI lists every configured upstream (#663, #706).
- **Dual-stack IPv4+IPv6 bind** — the `::` wildcard now accepts both address families (`IPV6_V6ONLY` cleared via socket2), with a `0.0.0.0` fallback when IPv6 is unavailable, so the default container bind serves both (#696).
- **Docker OCI single-POST monolithic blob upload** — `POST /v2/<name>/blobs/uploads/?digest=...` is now supported per the OCI Distribution spec (#698).
- **Docker Range requests for blob GET** — `Range` / `206 Partial Content` enables resumable image pulls (#657).
- **`nora healthcheck` CLI subcommand** — a dependency-free loopback probe for a Docker `HEALTHCHECK`; it ignores `HTTP_PROXY` and probes IPv4 loopback so it reaches a wildcard or `0.0.0.0` bind (#695, #701).
- **Compile-time integrity witnesses (typestate pilot)** — served artifacts carry a type-level proof that their hash-pin was discharged at the serve site; rolled out to the buffered-serve path (#666, #674).
- **Conditional-request revalidation for mutable/stale metadata** — Docker tags, the Cargo sparse index, Maven metadata, Go version listings, npm packuments, and Ansible / Gems / Conan / NuGet / Pub package metadata now revalidate against upstream (`If-None-Match` / TTL) before serving from cache instead of serving blindly stale (#639, #641, #643, #646, #647, #669, #670, #671, #672, #673).
- **Single-flight upstream coalescing** — concurrent cache-miss fetches for the same artifact collapse into one upstream request (#618); npm metadata revalidates with `If-None-Match` on TTL expiry (#617).
- **Per-registry observability** — per-registry artifact and storage gauges plus process uptime (#637), and curation allow/block decisions exposed via Prometheus (#636).
- **Configurable token-verify cache TTL** (`NORA_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_TTL`) — bounds the cross-replica token-revocation window (#668).
- **Operator re-pin recovery** — a CLI path to re-pin integrity-failed artifacts after the operator verifies them (#620).
- **Startup safety warnings** — NORA warns loudly when running without authentication (#635) and when `public_url` is unset on a loopback bind (#591).
- **Docker `default_action = deny`** — reject image names that match no configured upstream rule (#572).

### Changed
- **Dashboard counters are served from the Prometheus registry** instead of a separately-persisted `metrics.json` — the on-disk copy and its periodic write are gone, so the UI and `/metrics` can no longer disagree, and the figures are "since restart" (shown via a hover tooltip on the affected stat cards) (#626, #703, #706).
- Streamed Docker blob downloads no longer buffer the full blob in RAM (#580, #589).
- `serve-stale` behavior is aligned across all registry handlers (#576, #577).
- Client-facing URL construction (service-index rewriting, UI install commands, `docker pull`) is centralized in `ServerConfig::public_base_url()` / `public_host()`, replacing three divergent inline copies (#594).
- Instrumented the buffered `get()` integrity-verify cost (`nora_storage_verify_duration_seconds`) for capacity planning (#619).

### Fixed
- **Dashboard / UI** — the sidebar nav lists only enabled registries instead of all formats (#704, #705); real on-disk dashboard stats instead of virtual/double-counted figures (#621); search added to the Maven/Go browsers to match the list-page contract (#622).
- **Reverse-proxy sub-path mounts** — UI self-links, static assets, inline `fetch` calls, redirect `Location` headers, and the API-docs / Swagger URLs are now prefixed with the path component of `public_url`; root-vhost deploys are unaffected (the prefix is empty, a no-op) (#685, #686, #690). The UI `docker pull` command uses the bare host authority, and the IPv6 fallback base URL brackets the address (`http://[::1]:4000`).
- **PyPI** — percent-encoded filenames (e.g. `+cuXXX` wheels published as `%2B`) now match when proxying a custom index, instead of 404ing (#699).
- **Docker** — deleting a manifest by digest also removes tags that resolve to it (#697); manifest blob references are validated and tag writes serialized on push (#656); upload temp files orphaned by a write failure are swept on the periodic sweep, not only at boot (#683, #684); the release-image `HEALTHCHECK` uses `127.0.0.1` and supports IPv6 binds (#569, #570, #573).
- **Cargo** — the sparse-index rebuild is all-or-fail (a read error aborts instead of publishing a truncated/empty index and silently dropping versions) and regenerates from per-version entries instead of read-modify-write (#681, #682, #651).
- **npm** — the packument is regenerated from per-version keys instead of read-modify-write (#649).
- **Storage integrity** — `get()` fails closed on a hash-pin mismatch (#582, #600); hash-pin writes are durable and recorded before `put()` returns (#604, #613, #633); the streaming Docker-blob serve verifies the digest while streaming and aborts on tamper (#632); `health_check` write-probes the backing store instead of only checking the directory exists (#634).
- **GC** — a grace period stops the collector deleting blobs belonging to in-flight pushes (#584, #611).
- **Circuit breaker** — a stalled half-open probe is released instead of wedging at `503` (#585, #607); a 4xx probe recovers without masking real failures (#606, #614); probe reports are fenced by generation so a stale "lost" probe can't flip state (#667).
- **Backup** — the archive is published durably via temp file + `fsync` + rename (#678).
- **Observability** — the upstream-URL leak detector excludes NORA's own admin/UI/observability surface (`/api/`, `/api-docs`, `/ui`, `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`), counting each skip as `nora_leak_detection_skipped_total{reason="own_surface"}`, so `nora_response_upstream_url_leak_total` reflects only genuine proxy-response leaks and is alertable (#624).
- **Secrets** — the env provider preserves `VarError` context in errors (#592).

### Security
- **Min-release-age quarantine now fails closed on an unknown publish date** — `MinReleaseAgeFilter` returned `Skip` (defer, ultimately allow) when a package's publish date could not be determined, so an artifact whose age cannot be verified bypassed the quarantine. This was the one fail-open path in an otherwise fail-closed curation engine (the config layer already rejects `on_failure = "open"`). An unknown date is now blocked when the quarantine is active for that registry (threshold > 0); a registry with the quarantine disabled (threshold `0`) still defers (#679, #680).
- **Curation fails closed on a malformed SIGHUP policy reload** — a bad hot-reload no longer swaps in a broken engine; the active policy is kept (#586, #605).
- **Mirror verifies content digests before pushing** — both the manifest digest and each blob's SHA-256 are verified against the requested digest before a mirrored artifact is written (#587, #608, #609, #615).
- **OIDC `namespace_scope` is now enforced on writes** — it was previously parsed and documented as a per-provider access control but never applied at runtime (fail-open, #583). A provider's `namespace_scope` now restricts which artifact namespaces its tokens may publish to, across docker, raw, npm, maven, pypi and cargo. Matching is segment-aware (`myorg/*` matches `myorg/repo` but never `myorg-evil/...`; use `myorg/**` for everything under `myorg/`).
  - **BREAKING (behavioral):** if a provider's `namespace_scope` is set to anything other than `["*"]`, out-of-scope writes from that issuer now return `403`. The default `["*"]` is unchanged and remains a no-op, so deployments that never set the field are unaffected. **Check your OIDC config before upgrading.**
  - To stage the rollout, set `namespace_scope_enforcement = "audit"` on the provider: out-of-scope writes are allowed but logged and counted as `would_deny` via the new `nora_auth_namespace_scope_total{provider,decision}` metric. Switch to `"enforce"` (the default) once the metric is clean.
  - Scope applies to OIDC identities only; opaque (`nra_`) tokens and Basic auth are unaffected. Reads are never gated.

## [0.2.32] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed / Исправлено
- **Docker dashboard**: Namespaced images (library/alpine, grafana/grafana) now visible in UI — index builder finds manifests by position, not fixed index
- **Docker proxy**: Auto-prepend `library/` for single-segment official Hub images (nginx, alpine, node) — no need to explicitly use library/ prefix
- **CI**: Fixed cargo-deny license checks (NCSA for libfuzzer-sys, MIT for fuzz crate, unused-allowed-license config)
- **Docker dashboard**: Namespaced-образы (library/alpine, grafana/grafana) теперь отображаются в UI

## [0.2.31] - 2026-03-16

### Added / Добавлено
- **npm URL rewriting**: Tarball URLs in proxied metadata now rewritten to point to NORA (previously tarballs bypassed NORA and downloaded directly from npmjs.org)
- **npm scoped packages**: Full support for `@scope/package` in proxy handler and repository index
- **npm publish**: `PUT /npm/{package}` accepts standard npm publish payload with base64-encoded tarballs
- **npm metadata TTL**: Configurable cache TTL (`NORA_NPM_METADATA_TTL`, default 300s) with stale-while-revalidate fallback
- **Immutable cache**: SHA256 integrity verification on cached npm tarballs — detects tampering on cache hit
- **npm URL rewriting**: Tarball URL в проксированных метаданных теперь переписываются на NORA (ранее тарболы шли напрямую из npmjs.org)
- **npm scoped packages**: Полная поддержка `@scope/package` в прокси-хендлере и индексе репозитория
- **npm publish**: `PUT /npm/{package}` принимает стандартный npm publish payload с base64-тарболами

- **Immutable cache**: SHA256 проверка целостности npm-тарболов — обнаружение подмены при отдаче из кеша

### Security / Безопасность
- **Path traversal protection**: Attachment filename validation in npm publish (rejects `../`, `/`, `\`)
- **Package name mismatch**: npm publish rejects payloads where URL path doesn't match `name` field (anti-spoofing)
- **Version immutability**: npm publish returns 409 Conflict on duplicate version
- **Защита от path traversal**: Валидация имён файлов в npm publish (отклоняет `../`, `/`, `\`)
- **Проверка имени пакета**: npm publish отклоняет payload если имя в URL не совпадает с полем `name` (anti-spoofing)
- **Иммутабельность версий**: npm publish возвращает 409 Conflict при попытке перезаписать версию

### Fixed / Исправлено
- **npm proxy_auth**: `proxy_auth` field was configured but not wired into `fetch_from_proxy` — now sends Basic Auth header to upstream
- **npm proxy_auth**: Поле `proxy_auth` было в конфиге, но не передавалось в `fetch_from_proxy` — теперь отправляет Basic Auth в upstream


---

- Garbage collection scoped to Docker-only blobs — prevents GC from deleting non-Docker registry data (PR #109, @TickTockBent)
- Correct `zeroize` annotation placement and avoid secret cloning in `protected.rs` (PR #108, @TickTockBent)
- Docker push/pull: added PATCH endpoint for chunked uploads
## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- Go and Raw registries missing from Prometheus metrics (`detect_registry` labeled both as "other") (PR #97, @TickTockBent)
- Go and Raw registries missing from `/health` endpoint `registries` object (PR #97, @TickTockBent)
- Garbage collection scoped to Docker-only blobs — prevents GC from deleting non-Docker registry data (PR #109, @TickTockBent)
- Correct `zeroize` annotation placement and avoid secret cloning in `protected.rs` (PR #108, @TickTockBent)
- Rate limiting: health/metrics endpoints now exempt
- Increased upload rate limits for Docker parallel requests
## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

#### UI: SVG Brand Icons
- Replaced emoji icons with proper SVG brand icons (Simple Icons style)
- Docker, Maven, npm, Cargo, PyPI icons now render as scalable vector graphics
- Consistent icon styling across dashboard, sidebar, and detail pages

#### Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests for LocalStorage (8 tests): put/get, list, stat, health_check
- Unit tests for S3Storage with wiremock HTTP mocking (11 tests)
- Integration tests for auth/htpasswd (7 tests)
- Token lifecycle tests (11 tests)
- Validation tests (21 tests)
- **Total: 75 tests passing**

#### Security: Input Validation (`validation.rs`)
- Path traversal protection: rejects `../`, `..\\`, null bytes, absolute paths
- Docker image name validation per OCI distribution spec
- Content digest validation (`sha256:[64 hex]`, `sha512:[128 hex]`)
- Docker tag/reference validation
- Storage key length limits (max 1024 chars)

#### Security: Rate Limiting (`rate_limit.rs`)
- Auth endpoints: 1 req/sec, burst 5 (brute-force protection)
- Upload endpoints: 10 req/sec, burst 20
- General endpoints: 100 req/sec, burst 200
- Uses `tower_governor` 0.8 with `PeerIpKeyExtractor`

#### Observability: Request ID Tracking (`request_id.rs`)
- `X-Request-ID` header added to all responses
- Accepts upstream request ID or generates UUID v4
- Tracing spans include request_id for log correlation

#### CLI: Migrate Command (`migrate.rs`)
- `nora migrate --from local --to s3` - migrate between storage backends
- `--dry-run` flag for preview without copying
- Progress bar with indicatif
- Skips existing files in destination
- Summary statistics (migrated, skipped, failed, bytes)

#### Error Handling (`error.rs`)
- `AppError` enum with `IntoResponse` for Axum
- Automatic conversion from `StorageError` and `ValidationError`
- JSON error responses with request_id support

### Changed
- `StorageError` now uses `thiserror` derive macro
- `TokenError` now uses `thiserror` derive macro
- Storage wrapper validates keys before delegating to backend
- Docker registry handlers validate name, digest, reference inputs
- Body size limit set to 100MB default via `DefaultBodyLimit`

### Dependencies Added
- `thiserror = "2"` - typed error handling
- `tower_governor = "0.8"` - rate limiting
- `governor = "0.10"` - rate limiting backend
- `tempfile = "3"` (dev) - temporary directories for tests
- `wiremock = "0.6"` (dev) - HTTP mocking for S3 tests

### Files Added
- `src/validation.rs` - input validation module
- `src/migrate.rs` - storage migration module
- `src/error.rs` - application error types
- `src/request_id.rs` - request ID middleware
- `src/rate_limit.rs` - rate limiting configuration
## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- Multi-protocol support: Docker Registry v2, Maven, npm, Cargo, PyPI
- Web UI dashboard
- Swagger UI (`/api-docs`)
- Storage backends: Local filesystem, S3-compatible
- Smart proxy/cache for Maven and npm
- Health checks (`/health`, `/ready`)
- Basic authentication (htpasswd with bcrypt)
- API tokens (revocable, per-user)
- Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`)
- JSON structured logging
- Environment variable configuration
- Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
- Backup/restore commands
