# Changelog
## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Cargo sparse-index rebuild is now all-or-fail** — regenerating the index swallowed a transient list/read error (`unwrap_or_default()` on the entry listing, `if let Ok` per entry), so an I/O blip could publish a truncated — or empty — index as authoritative and silently drop versions a client had already published successfully. A read error now aborts the rebuild (the publish returns `500` and the existing index stays intact); a genuinely empty crate is still handled as empty (#681).
- **Docker pull command in the UI** — the package detail view built `docker pull` from `public_url` verbatim, so a configured `public_url` with a scheme produced an invalid `docker pull https://host/image`. The pull command now uses the bare host authority.
- **IPv6 fallback base URL** — when `public_url` is unset and the bind host is an IPv6 literal, the advertised base URL now brackets the address (`http://[::1]:4000`), matching the listen address format.
- **False-positive upstream-URL leak warnings on the admin/UI surface** — the leak detector scanned every JSON response, so endpoints that legitimately present configured upstream URLs (the dashboard, stats, OpenAPI spec) logged a spurious `WARN` and incremented `nora_response_upstream_url_leak_total` on every request, drowning the signal for real proxy-response leaks (#624). NORA's own admin/UI/observability paths (`/api/`, `/api-docs`, `/ui`, `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`) are now excluded from the scan, and each skip is counted as `nora_leak_detection_skipped_total{reason="own_surface"}`. Registry proxy paths stay fully scanned, so `nora_response_upstream_url_leak_total` now reflects only genuine leaks and a non-zero rate is alertable.

### Internal
- Client-facing URL construction (service index rewriting, UI install commands, docker pull) is now centralized in `ServerConfig::public_base_url()` / `public_host()`, replacing three divergent inline copies.

### Security
- **Min-release-age quarantine now fails closed on an unknown publish date** — `MinReleaseAgeFilter` returned `Skip` (defer, ultimately allow) when a package's publish date could not be determined, so an artifact whose age cannot be verified bypassed the quarantine entirely. This was the one fail-open path in an otherwise fail-closed curation engine — the config layer already rejects `on_failure = "open"`. An unknown date is now blocked when the quarantine is active for that registry (threshold > 0); a registry with the quarantine disabled (threshold `0`) still defers (#679).
- **OIDC `namespace_scope` is now enforced on writes** — it was previously parsed and documented as a per-provider access control but never applied at runtime (fail-open, #583). A provider's `namespace_scope` now restricts which artifact namespaces its tokens may publish to, across docker, raw, npm, maven, pypi and cargo. Matching is segment-aware (`myorg/*` matches `myorg/repo` but never `myorg-evil/...`; use `myorg/**` for everything under `myorg/`).
  - **BREAKING (behavioral):** if a provider's `namespace_scope` is set to anything other than `["*"]`, out-of-scope writes from that issuer now return `403`. The default `["*"]` is unchanged and remains a no-op, so deployments that never set the field are unaffected. **Check your OIDC config before upgrading.**
  - To stage the rollout, set `namespace_scope_enforcement = "audit"` on the provider: out-of-scope writes are allowed but logged and counted as `would_deny` via the new `nora_auth_namespace_scope_total{provider,decision}` metric. Switch to `"enforce"` (the default) once the metric is clean.
  - Scope applies to OIDC identities only; opaque (`nra_`) tokens and Basic auth are unaffected. Reads are never gated.

- **Retention Prometheus metrics** — `nora_retention_versions_deleted_total`, `nora_retention_bytes_freed_total`, `nora_retention_duration_seconds`, `nora_retention_last_run_timestamp`
- **GC expanded to all registries** — Go incomplete version detection (missing `.info` or `.zip`), Cargo index/crate cross-check, Maven/npm/PyPI checksum orphans, Docker blob orphans
- **GC/Retention visibility** — reports uncovered registries with file counts after each run
- **Go retention collector** — `keep_last` for Go modules, parsing `module/@v/version.{info,mod,zip}`
- **Audit log** — one entry per retention run with keys/bytes/duration
- 588 total tests (up from 577)

### Changed
- GC now requires `--apply` flag to delete (dry-run by default)
- Retention requires `--yes` to apply (plan-only by default)
- Binary size reduced from 60MB to 21MB (stripped debug symbols in release profile)
- `RetentionConfig` expanded with `enabled`, `interval` fields and env var overrides (`NORA_RETENTION_ENABLED`, `NORA_RETENTION_INTERVAL`)

### Fixed
- `md-5` crate aligned to `0.11` (compatible with `digest 0.11`), replacing `md5 0.7` which lacked `Digest` trait
- Clippy warnings cleaned up across all modules
- `dead_code` warning on `ArtifactMeta` suppressed
- Token sorting uses `sort_by_key` for stability

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Cargo sparse index (RFC 2789)** — cargo can now use NORA as a proper registry with `sparse+http://` protocol, including `config.json`, prefix-based index lookup, and `cargo publish` wire format support
- **Cargo publish** — full publish flow with wire format parsing, version immutability (409 Conflict), SHA-256 checksums in sparse index, and proper `warnings` response format
- **PyPI twine upload** — `twine upload` via multipart/form-data with SHA-256 verification, filename validation, and version immutability
- **PEP 691 JSON API** — content negotiation via `Accept: application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json` for package index and version listing, with hash digests in responses
- 577 total tests (up from 504), including 25 new Cargo tests and 18 new PyPI tests

### Fixed
- Go and Raw registries missing from Prometheus metrics (`detect_registry` labeled both as "other") (PR #97, @TickTockBent)
- Go and Raw registries missing from `/health` endpoint `registries` object (PR #97, @TickTockBent)
- Garbage collection scoped to Docker-only blobs — prevents GC from deleting non-Docker registry data (PR #109, @TickTockBent)
- Correct `zeroize` annotation placement and avoid secret cloning in `protected.rs` (PR #108, @TickTockBent)
- Cargo dependency field mapping: `version_req` correctly renamed to `req` and `explicit_name_in_toml` to `package` in sparse index entries, matching Cargo registry specification
- Cargo crate names normalized to lowercase across all endpoints (publish, download, metadata, sparse index) for consistent storage keys
- Cargo publish write ordering: index written before .crate tarball to prevent orphaned files on partial failure
- Cargo conflict errors now return Cargo-compatible JSON format (`{"errors": [{"detail": "..."}]}`)
- PyPI hash fragments preserved when rewriting upstream links (PEP 503 compliance)
- Redundant path traversal checks removed from crate name validation (charset already excludes unsafe characters)

### Changed
- Cargo sparse index and config.json responses include `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`
- Cargo .crate downloads include `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` and `Content-Type: application/x-tar`
- axum upgraded with `multipart` feature for PyPI upload support

## [0.2.32] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed / Исправлено
- **Docker dashboard**: Namespaced images (library/alpine, grafana/grafana) now visible in UI — index builder finds manifests by position, not fixed index
- **Docker proxy**: Auto-prepend `library/` for single-segment official Hub images (nginx, alpine, node) — no need to explicitly use library/ prefix
- **CI**: Fixed cargo-deny license checks (NCSA for libfuzzer-sys, MIT for fuzz crate, unused-allowed-license config)
- **Docker dashboard**: Namespaced-образы (library/alpine, grafana/grafana) теперь отображаются в UI

## [0.2.31] - 2026-03-16

### Added / Добавлено
- **npm URL rewriting**: Tarball URLs in proxied metadata now rewritten to point to NORA (previously tarballs bypassed NORA and downloaded directly from npmjs.org)
- **npm scoped packages**: Full support for `@scope/package` in proxy handler and repository index
- **npm publish**: `PUT /npm/{package}` accepts standard npm publish payload with base64-encoded tarballs
- **npm metadata TTL**: Configurable cache TTL (`NORA_NPM_METADATA_TTL`, default 300s) with stale-while-revalidate fallback
- **Immutable cache**: SHA256 integrity verification on cached npm tarballs — detects tampering on cache hit
- **npm URL rewriting**: Tarball URL в проксированных метаданных теперь переписываются на NORA (ранее тарболы шли напрямую из npmjs.org)
- **npm scoped packages**: Полная поддержка `@scope/package` в прокси-хендлере и индексе репозитория
- **npm publish**: `PUT /npm/{package}` принимает стандартный npm publish payload с base64-тарболами

- **Immutable cache**: SHA256 проверка целостности npm-тарболов — обнаружение подмены при отдаче из кеша

### Security / Безопасность
- **Path traversal protection**: Attachment filename validation in npm publish (rejects `../`, `/`, `\`)
- **Package name mismatch**: npm publish rejects payloads where URL path doesn't match `name` field (anti-spoofing)
- **Version immutability**: npm publish returns 409 Conflict on duplicate version
- **Защита от path traversal**: Валидация имён файлов в npm publish (отклоняет `../`, `/`, `\`)
- **Проверка имени пакета**: npm publish отклоняет payload если имя в URL не совпадает с полем `name` (anti-spoofing)
- **Иммутабельность версий**: npm publish возвращает 409 Conflict при попытке перезаписать версию

### Fixed / Исправлено
- **npm proxy_auth**: `proxy_auth` field was configured but not wired into `fetch_from_proxy` — now sends Basic Auth header to upstream
- **npm proxy_auth**: Поле `proxy_auth` было в конфиге, но не передавалось в `fetch_from_proxy` — теперь отправляет Basic Auth в upstream


---
